### Week 2 - Exercise 4

Find at least three statistical visualizations that you think aren’t very good, and identify their problems. 
Copying examples from various junk chart websites isn’t accepted – you should find your own junk charts. 
You should be able to find good (or rather, bad) examples quite easily since a large fraction of charts 
have at least some issues. The examples you choose should also have different problems, so don’t look for 
three column or bar charts whose axes don’t begin at zero. Try to find as interesting and diverse examples as you can.
